Latent Works is a series of 77 artworks generated and stored entirely on chain. As Latent Works is built on the ERC1155 token standard, each artwork has multiple editions - 7 to be exact. When an edition is minted it advances and evolves the artwork for all holders using a seed generated on the first mint. Latent Works are in this way both individually owned and jointly shared at the same time.

Individual works iterate according to a set course, their fate, which is determined by the time they are first minted. Wether that fate is fulfilled depends on the participants. No mints, no art - only the latent potential remains on chain.

This experiment in shared ownership and evolving generative art is released over the course of 7 days, one edition at a time. Minting is sequential, meaning the contract mints an entire edition of 77 artworks before advancing to the next one, and so on through the 7 editions.

Mint price will be 0.07 ETH + gas.
